## Loki (face recognition project)

The objective of this project is to implement a face recognition (FR) solution 
like the one present in Google photos.

# Progress checklist
 - [ ] Phase 1: Face Detection
 - [ ] Phase 2: Face Alignment
 - [ ] Phase 3: Face Recognition

# Demos
 - **[face_detection_with_retinaface](demos/face_detection_with_retinaface.ipynb)** - self-contained Google Colab
 demonstrating face detection using RetinaFace and image downloaded online. This demo is fully explained and commented.

 - **[GC_functionality_demo](demos/GC_deepface_functionality.ipynb)** - 
 illustrates several different functionalities using the deepface framework,
 including face detection, alignment, verification/recognition, attribute
 analysis. GoogleColab version - no setup required, hooray!

 - **[GC_lfw_face_recognition](demos/GC_lfw_face_recognition.ipynb)** -
 evaluates the performance of the face recognition system on a subset of the
 Labelled Faces in the Wild (LFW) data set. The confusion matrix is provided
 along with other important metrics such as accuracy, false positive, false
 negative, etc.
